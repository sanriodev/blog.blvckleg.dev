## About this blog

Hi, I recently tried to implement a cool blogging feature on [my website](https://blvckleg.dev).

However the libraries used to render markdown in react.js were quite a pain to use and did not quite satisfy my needs.

That's when I found out about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). And I quickly decided to create a website specifically for blogging with it and host it on it's own subdomain.

So... again... if you're reading this and you're not me, Welcome!

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello blog.blvckleg.dev")
}
```

```bash
go run hello.go
```
